To downgrade the version of Angular from 16 to 13, you can follow these general steps:

1. Uninstall the current version of Angular CLI:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
   ```

2. Clear the npm cache:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. Install the desired version of Angular CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli@13
   ```

4. Update the Angular packages in your project:
   In your project directory, update the `@angular` packages to version 13:
   ```bash
   ng update @angular/core@13 @angular/cli@13
   ```

5. Verify the Angular version:
   Verify that the Angular version has been downgraded to 13 by running the following command:
   ```bash
   ng version
   ```

Please note that downgrading the Angular version may cause compatibility issues with other libraries and dependencies in your project. It's important to review the documentation and release notes of the libraries and dependencies you are using to ensure their compatibility with Angular 13.

Also, it's recommended to create a backup of your project before downgrading the Angular version to avoid any potential data loss or corruption.
