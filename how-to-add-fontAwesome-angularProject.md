It seems that you are trying to use the Font Awesome `faCartPlus` icon in your Angular application, but you are encountering an error related to the `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` module. To resolve this issue, you need to import the `faCartPlus` icon correctly. Here are the steps:

1. Make sure you have installed Font Awesome and the necessary packages:

   First, ensure that you have installed Font Awesome and the required packages. You can use npm or yarn to install them. Run the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   npm install --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
   npm install --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
   npm install --save @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome
   ```

   Or if you prefer yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn add @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
   yarn add @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
   yarn add @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome
   ```

2. Import the `faCartPlus` icon:

   In your Angular component where you want to use the `faCartPlus` icon, make sure to import it like this:

   ```typescript
   import { Component } from '@angular/core';
   import { faCartPlus } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-your-component',
     template: `
       <fa-icon [icon]="cartIcon"></fa-icon>
     `,
   })
   export class YourComponent {
     cartIcon = faCartPlus;
   }
   ```

   Make sure that you are importing it from `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`.

3. Use the icon in your template:

   You can use the `cartIcon` variable in your template to display the `faCartPlus` icon.

   ```html
   <fa-icon [icon]="cartIcon"></fa-icon>
   ```

   Replace `'app-your-component'` with your actual component selector and adjust the template as needed.

By following these steps, you should be able to use the `faCartPlus` icon in your Angular application without any issues. Make sure that your project is correctly configured and dependencies are up to date.

Yes, you can inject the Font Awesome icons into your Angular application's AppModule to make them available globally across your application. Here's how you can do it:

1. In your `app.module.ts` file, import the necessary Font Awesome modules:

   ```typescript
   import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
   import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
   import { FontAwesomeModule } from '@fortawesome/angular-fontawesome';
   import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core';
   import { faCartPlus } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

   import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

   // Add the Font Awesome icons you want to use globally to the library
   library.add(faCartPlus);

   @NgModule({
     declarations: [AppComponent],
     imports: [BrowserModule, FontAwesomeModule],
     bootstrap: [AppComponent],
   })
   export class AppModule {}
   ```

2. In the code above, we import the `FontAwesomeModule` and add the `faCartPlus` icon to the global library using `library.add(faCartPlus)`.

3. Once you've added the icons to the library in your AppModule, you can use them in any component or template throughout your application without needing to import them individually in each component.

Here's how you can use the `faCartPlus` icon in a component's template:

```html
<!-- YourComponent.html -->
<fa-icon [icon]="['fas', 'cart-plus']"></fa-icon>
```

In this example, we're referencing the `faCartPlus` icon using `['fas', 'cart-plus']`, where `'fas'` is the prefix for Font Awesome Solid icons, and `'cart-plus'` is the icon name.

By injecting the icons into your AppModule, you make them globally available, simplifying their use in different parts of your Angular application.
