# Angular CLI Generate Commands

In Angular, you can use the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) to generate various parts of your application. These commands help you scaffold and structure your Angular application efficiently. Here are the commonly used Angular CLI generate commands:

## 1. Generate a New Component:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

## 2. Generate a New Module:

```bash
ng generate module module-name
```

## 3. Generate a New Service:

```bash
ng generate service service-name
```

## 4. Generate a New Directive:

```bash
ng generate directive directive-name
```

## 5. Generate a New Pipe:

```bash
ng generate pipe pipe-name
```

## 6. Generate a New Class:

```bash
ng generate class class-name
```

## 7. Generate a New Interface:

```bash
ng generate interface interface-name
```

## 8. Generate a New Enum:

```bash
ng generate enum enum-name
```

## 9. Generate a New Module with Routing:

```bash
ng generate module module-name --routing
```

## 10. Generate a New Guard:

```bash
ng generate guard guard-name
```

## 11. Generate a New Resolver:

```bash
ng generate resolver resolver-name
```

## 12. Generate a New Component within a Module:

```bash
ng generate component module-name/component-name
```

These commands create the necessary files and update the application's module files and other dependencies. You can customize the generated code by specifying additional options and flags in the command.

For more details on each command and additional options, you can use the `--help` flag with any Angular CLI command. For example:

```bash
ng generate component --help
```

This will provide you with a list of available options and explanations for the command.
