To install Bootstrap, Angular Material, and Font Awesome for an Angular project, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Bootstrap:
   ```
   npm install bootstrap
   ```

2. Install Angular Material:
   ```
   ng add @angular/material
   ```

3. Install Font Awesome:
   ```
   npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
   npm install @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
   npm install @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons
   npm install @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
   ```

After installing these packages, you can import them in your Angular project as needed. For example, to use Font Awesome icons, you can add the following line to your `styles.scss` file:
```
@import '~@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.css';
```

To import packages in `angular.json`, you can add the package names to the `"styles"` and `"scripts"` arrays in the `"build"` and `"test"` targets of your project. For example, to import Bootstrap and Font Awesome, you can add the following lines to your `angular.json` file:

```
"build": {
  "options": {
    "styles": [
      "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
      "node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css",
      "src/styles.scss"
    ],
    "scripts": [
      "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
      "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"
    ]
  }
},
"test": {
  "options": {
    "styles": [
      "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
      "node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.min.css",
      "src/styles.scss"
    ],
    "scripts": [
      "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
      "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"
    ]
  }
},
```

This will import the necessary CSS and JavaScript files for Bootstrap and Font Awesome in your Angular project. Note that you may need to adjust the file paths depending on the location of your `node_modules` folder and the specific versions of the packages you are using.

To use Angular libraries published to npm, you need to install the package and import the provided functionality in the location you use it[1]. The packages listed in the dependencies section of package.json are essential to running applications[2]. The angular.json file at the root level of an Angular workspace provides workspace-wide and project-specific configuration defaults[4]. To create and publish new libraries to extend Angular functionality, you can follow the steps outlined in the Angular documentation[5]. However, if you want to import a JSON file to an Angular library, you can add the file to the assets folder of the library and then import it using the HttpClient module[6]. 

In summary, to use external packages like Bootstrap, Angular Material, and Font Awesome in an Angular project, you need to install the package and import the provided functionality in the location you use it. You can also add the necessary CSS and JavaScript files to the `"styles"` and `"scripts"` arrays in the `"build"` and `"test"` targets of your `angular.json` file to import them globally in your project.
